# Smart-Interview-OA-Bot
It is a simple web-based tool that helps you explore and prepare for interview questions.
You can type any interview question or topic, and the app will try to:
 - Predict the Topic and Difficulty of the question
 - Guess the Company (if company tags are available in the dataset)
 - Show you similar questions from the database to expand your preparation
I built this project mainly to practice working with text data, machine learning pipelines, and creating interactive apps using Streamlit.
